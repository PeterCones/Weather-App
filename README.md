## User Experience

### Strategy


### Scope


### Structure




### Skeleton

Balsamiq Wireframes were used to plan the layout of the site. 



### Surface 
 

## Design

From a design perspective, our main goal was to relay information the end-user visually.

To achieve this we included the following features:

- Interactive map
- Cards displaying weather information
- Dynamic background

### Interactive Map
The interactive map acts as a hero section, immediately drawing the attention of the end-user.

This design approach allowed us to focus on functionality as a primary, due to the amount of content to which the user is presented.

### Weather Cards
On the map itself we have included a current temperature reading. This allows the end-user to quickly glance & gain useful insights re there entered location. 

Scrolling further down the page reveals further weather information, this time in the form of cards.

The cards display images and weather data dependent on weather conditions & user location.

### Dynamic Background

We decided that the websites theme/background should change dependant on weather conditions.

To achieve this we applied different classes to the body based on data retrieved from the API.
